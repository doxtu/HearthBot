This folder contains prebuilt browser versions of [protobuf.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/protobuf.js). When sending pull requests, it is not required to update these.

Alternatively, you can also use [the minimal runtime](./runtime) when working with statically generated code or [the noparse build](./noparse) when working with JSON generated by `pbjs` *only*.

Prebuilt files are in source control to enable pain-free frontend respectively CDN usage:
