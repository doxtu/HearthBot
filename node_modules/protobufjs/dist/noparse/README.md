This slightly smaller version of the full library can be used as a drop-in replacment where .proto parsing is not required, i.e. when only working with JSON files generated by pbjs as recommended for production. To achieve the same with browserify, simply [exclude](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook#excluding) `./tokenize`, `./parse` and `./common`.

Prebuilt files are in source control to enable pain-free frontend respectively CDN usage:
