Todo:

-Fix bot flow sequence. Currently, this is how the bot works:

1. Sets up to listen to incoming data.
2. Runs mulligan state.
3. Runs first turn
4. Sets up global turn/decode
5. Waits and executes turns holistically. 

This is how the bot should work:

1. Take in initial data correctly (verify)
2. Mulligan and wait for turn
3. Analyze board and hand. (when turn comes)
4. Make play (play card, attack, heropower)
5. Update AI state.
6. Return to 3 until no more possible moves.
7. End turn.
8. Wait for next turn.

Example code
------------

//Variable declaration,
//and listening for powerhistory

init();

//When data is received, update AI/Game
onData () => 
Game.update() && AI.update();


//Mulligan will happen first no matter what
//Make sure that it happens first
onMulligan(
	AI.mulligan();
	Game.update() && AI.update();
	if(firstTurn) turn();
)

//make sure the AI waits while the move is being
//made and that it allows the game to update
turn () =>
	while(mana > 0)
		AI.makemove();
	AI.endturn();

//cleanup and be neato burrito
over() =>
	AI.wellplayed();
	cleanup();
	AI.startnew();
	init();
	gamecount++;
